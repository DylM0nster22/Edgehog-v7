## 10/5/2025 - Started the cad and go a basic design setup  

I started off with doing some research on what motors I was going to do for the drive of this robot, in previous versions I've done a type of drive called Alex drive which is a complicated drive with a mix of gears and belts, for this version I am doing a complete remake and I spent an hour or so talking with different providers about gearboxes and I think I am going to figure out how to mount the brushless motor to a gearbox from a brushes motor. I'm waiting on providers to reply back as of now. As for the CAD side of things I chose my electronics and made a weapon ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDkxLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--a8968808ec250f1b8b11a4cd3febd594cb0d304c/image.png)

The drive motors will look something like this

## 10/6/2025 - Created a custom planetary gearbox  

Today I spent some more time messaging people on AliExpress and Alibaba asking them about different gearbox's, but none have the information I needed, so I gave up on that and I spent a few hours messing with gear ratios and ended up making a fully custom 3d printed planetary gearbox that I'm printing out tonight to test. Other than that I didn't really do anything on it today
