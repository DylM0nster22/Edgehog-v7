## 10/4/2025 - Started the cad and go a basic design setup  

I started off with doing some research on what motors I was going to do for the drive of this robot, in previous versions I've done a type of drive called Alex drive which is a complicated drive with a mix of gears and belts, for this version I am doing a complete remake and I spent an hour or so talking with different providers about gearboxes and I think I am going to figure out how to mount the brushless motor to a gearbox from a brushes motor. I'm waiting on providers to reply back as of now. As for the CAD side of things I chose my electronics and made a weapon ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDkxLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--a8968808ec250f1b8b11a4cd3febd594cb0d304c/image.png)

The drive motors will look something like this

## 10/5/2025 - Created a custom planetary gearbox  

Today I spent some more time messaging people on AliExpress and Alibaba asking them about different gearbox's, but none have the information I needed, so I gave up on that and I spent a few hours messing with gear ratios and ended up making a fully custom 3d printed planetary gearbox that I'm printing out tonight to test. Other than that I didn't really do anything on it today

## 10/7/2025 7 AM - Messes around with the gearbox and continued cadding  

So the gearbox didn't work great so far I'm on my third or fourth version of it with the first issue being I couldn't get the parts in, then the second being the plastic nubs I had to mount gears to not having enough strength which I fixed by making those m2 screws then I have an issue with it being too tight, currently I am waiting for it to finish 3d printing again so I can test it. As for the cad side of things I am thinking that the gearbox may not be strong enough so I might have to switch to repeat robotics mk4's or a similar brushless drive motor.![image.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTI5LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--2e47755c62500bf00e64e500de4179c90633e545/image.jpg)
  

## 10/7/2025 9 PM - Created the upright and had a relization  

So today i got the gear boxes working and was testing them before i relized the shaft wouldent be able to take nearly enough torque because i was spinning the whole gearbox from said shaft and the shfat just bent off on three different pieces even with a screw centraly supporting it. So then i reseached different drive motors and decided on the repeat robotics mk4s beofre i them learned the 4mm version is out of stock everywhere. So now im going to use a 3lb robot drive motor called the repeat compacts which use 1806 motor which is slightly bigger then my custom gearbox motor and a lot lot stronger. Today i also designed the uprights but i think im going to have to change things up with the new bigger motor. This is the difference between a mk4 and a compact with the mk4 being on the right ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTAyMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--01077b9f78e1ab5de18093b4c7a9db9fd8305fb1/image.png)

here is the upright i designed too it needs a bit of work

## 10/10/2025 - Fleshed out the robot and messed with the wheels  

I started this yesterday but i forgot to add a log, so today i fleshed out the robot by adding a bunch of things and starting to do weight calculations to see if it will be underweight, first i got proper wheels imported, then i started making things look good and be stronger by adding a bunch if filets and overall making it look smoother. its going to be really close with the weight but i think it might be underweight with the 3lb drive motors

This is my weight without armor so i might be cooked

## 10/14/2025 - Today I finished the robot!!!  

Today I finished the robot!!! today I started with remaking the uprights a little bit to make them smaller and make it possible to drive upside down, then i had to remake the top lid too. after that i finally got the design down for the armor after a few revisions. after all of that I did weight calcs with it being solid and was stupidly overweight thankfully i dont need everything to be solid so when i was messing with print settings i was able to get it underweight. here is a side profile ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjI1MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fb2639d2e8c26aff46e7979072fea6bcdb3d0a61/image.png)
here is a front view ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjI1MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--50a4556f903ddf1257dd32b9da6432b6ee6087bc/image.png)
And here's a top view ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjI1MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--34e443df609964bacc9987b8ee8a905b74f92e17/image.png)
heres my weight calcs, ill add links to populate the bom soon ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjI1MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b6a25a245af992bf129c7ab2eb33768f20d8f842/image.png)

UPDATE: I relized i forgot to say some major things, like i switched away from using the 3lb motors and instead switched to mk4 motors which are made for 1lb weight clases, and the only version of those in stock is a 3mm shaft which is too weak so i also had to include the 4mm shaft upgrade
