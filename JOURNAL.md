## 10/5/2025 - Started the cad and go a basic design setup  

I started off with doing some research on what motors I was going to do for the drive of this robot, in previous versions I've done a type of drive called Alex drive which is a complicated drive with a mix of gears and belts, for this version I am doing a complete remake and I spent an hour or so talking with different providers about gearboxes and I think I am going to figure out how to mount the brushless motor to a gearbox from a brushes motor. I'm waiting on providers to reply back as of now. As for the CAD side of things I chose my electronics and made a weapon ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDkxLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--a8968808ec250f1b8b11a4cd3febd594cb0d304c/image.png)

The drive motors will look something like this

## 10/6/2025 - Created a custom planetary gearbox  

Today I spent some more time messaging people on AliExpress and Alibaba asking them about different gearbox's, but none have the information I needed, so I gave up on that and I spent a few hours messing with gear ratios and ended up making a fully custom 3d printed planetary gearbox that I'm printing out tonight to test. Other than that I didn't really do anything on it today

## 10/7/2025 - Messes around with the gearbox and continued cadding  

So the gearbox didn't work great so far I'm on my third or fourth version of it with the first issue being I couldn't get the parts in, then the second being the plastic nubs I had to mount gears to not having enough strength which I fixed by making those m2 screws then I have an issue with it being too tight, currently I am waiting for it to finish 3d printing again so I can test it. As for the cad side of things I am thinking that the gearbox may not be strong enough so I might have to switch to repeat robotics mk4's or a similar brushless drive motor.![image.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTI5LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--2e47755c62500bf00e64e500de4179c90633e545/image.jpg)
  

## 10/8/2025 - Created the upright and had a relization  

So today i got the gear boxes working and was testing them before i relized the shaft wouldent be able to take nearly enough torque because i was spinning the whole gearbox from said shaft and the shfat just bent off on three different pieces even with a screw centraly supporting it. So then i reseached different drive motors and decided on the repeat robotics mk4s beofre i them learned the 4mm version is out of stock everywhere. So now im going to use a 3lb robot drive motor called the repeat compacts which use 1806 motor which is slightly bigger then my custom gearbox motor and a lot lot stronger. Today i also designed the uprights but i think im going to have to change things up with the new bigger motor. This is the difference between a mk4 and a compact with the mk4 being on the right ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTAyMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--01077b9f78e1ab5de18093b4c7a9db9fd8305fb1/image.png)

here is the upright i designed too it needs a bit of work
